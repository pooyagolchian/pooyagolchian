### Pooya Golchian

I am a frontend developer who curious about clean code. I am so enthusiastic about javascript and frontend technology. I have good knowledge of Linux and Operating systems. One of my hubbies is open-source contributing and use them in the application. I love Vue.js and React.js. I worked as a Vue.js developer for 3 years and a React.js developer for 1 year. I learned a React.js new feature like React Hook, etc. I want to work with a team that beliefs in clean code and test. I am a fast learner and curious about high-tech stuff. I've been worked as a web developer since 2012. My first struggle in this field is related to Drupal.
