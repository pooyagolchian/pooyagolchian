### Pooya Golchian

I am a front-end developer. I have a master's degree in Software Engineering. I worked with lots of startup and enterprise companies.  I am an attention to detail and pixel-perfect front-end developer. I love blogging and contributing to open-source projects. I have good experience in front-end architecture projects that work withVue.js and React.js. I have been working as a web developer since 2012 till now. I love other stuff in development like DevOps and back-end. I chose javascript for my career for both sides of development.

Currently, I work in Azkivam.com that which works in the lend-tech business. I developed our application with Vue.js and Nuxt.js.
