### Pooya Golchian

I have worked as a front-end developer since 2012. I like to transfer the design to code. Web application architecture, UX, and front-end are my favorite things that I enjoyed in my work career. Moreover, problem-solving, communication, and leadership that other skills I have been developing in five recent years. I have worked with different startup and organization software engineering companies in Iran. Close communication with the product team and working with scrum methodology during these years made me agile and flexible for the different circumstances that every application would be in it. In addition, I have worked with DevOps tools. I'm an engineer at my heart. On top of that, I'd love javascript to the bone. I like to be in an international career to improve my work environment and expand my knowledge horizon.
