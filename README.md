### Pooya Golchian

With over eleven years of dedicated experience as a front-end and software developer, I have refined my craft in designing and executing high-performance web applications that not only meet but often surpass business expectations. My passion for turning intricate designs into functional, user-friendly interfaces has been a constant throughout my career. Specializing in React.js, Vue.js, and Nest.js, I've developed a keen expertise in building accessible, efficient web solutions, seamlessly translating business needs into technical achievements.

In recent years, my focus has expanded to include web application architecture, UX design, and the nuanced intricacies of front-end development, areas where I have both contributed and thrived. My career has been marked by a commitment to continuous improvement in problem-solving, communication, and leadership, skills that I have diligently developed over the last five years.

My journey has led me to collaborate with diverse startups and established organizations in Iran, and more recently in Dubai, UAE, where I've embraced the challenges and opportunities presented in these dynamic environments. My experience working closely with product teams and employing agile methodologies like Scrum has made me adaptable and resilient, ready to tackle the unique challenges each application presents. Moreover, my work with DevOps tools underscores my holistic understanding of the software development lifecycle, further solidifying my engineering acumen.

JavaScript, to me, is more than just a programming language; it's a passion. I revel in the depth of its capabilities and its transformative power in web development. As I look to the future, I'm eager to extend my professional journey onto the international stage, seeking opportunities to enhance my work environment and broaden my technical and cultural horizons.

Technologies I bring to the table include ES6, JavaScript, TypeScript, React.js, Redux, Vue.js, Vuex, SCSS, Material UI, HTML, CSS, AWS, Docker, Git, GitHub, GitHub Actions, NPM packages, Linux, and the JAM Stack, among others. This technical prowess, combined with my leadership and project management skills, positions me as a valuable asset to any team looking to innovate and excel in the digital space.
